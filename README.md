Includes my practice of Data structures and Algorithms

Step 1: Download the file, it is code of seive of eratosthenes using Data Struture Algorithms.

Step 2: You can execute it by using offline compiler like Visual Studio Code,Code Blocks,IntelliJ.

Step 3: Also by using online compiler like online GDB compiler "https://www.onlinegdb.com/"


# Description about code
  # Seive of Eratothenes
  
Step 1: Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple and ancient algorithm used to find the prime numbers up to any given limit.

Step 2: It is one of the most efficient ways to find small prime numbers.

Step 3: For a given upper limit n the algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of primes as composite, starting from 2.
